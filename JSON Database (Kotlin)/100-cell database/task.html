<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>JSON database is a single file database that stores information in the form of JSON. It is a remote database, so it's usually accessed through the Internet.</p>
<p>In this stage, you need to simulate a database that can store text information in an array of size 100. From the start of the database, every cell contains an empty string. Users can save strings in the cells, read the information from these cells, and delete that information if needed. After a string has been deleted, that cell should contain an empty string.</p>
<p>The user can use the <code class="java">set</code>, <code class="java">get</code>, or <code class="java">delete</code> commands.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>After <code class="java">set</code>, a user should specify a number (<code class="java">1</code>-<code class="java">100</code>) and the text that will be saved to the cell. If the index is wrong, the program should output <code class="java">ERROR</code>, otherwise, output <code class="java">OK</code>. If the specified cell already contains information, it should be overwritten.</li>
<li>After <code class="java">get</code>, a user should specify the cell number from which they want to get information. If the cell is empty or the index is wrong, the program should output <code class="java">ERROR</code>; otherwise, the program should output the content of the cell.</li>
<li>After <code class="java">delete</code>, the user should specify the number of the cell. If the index is wrong, the program should output <code class="java">ERROR</code>; otherwise, output <code class="java">OK</code>. If the string is empty, you don't have to do anything. </li>
<li>To exit the program, a user should enter <code class="java">exit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should run from the main function of the <strong>server</strong> package.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; get 1
